## Hi, I’m Alejo García 👋 
### (@alejoegarcia on most social media)

> I'm a nineteen-years-old backend-leaning full stack developer 👨🏽‍💻. I got into the programming world almost six years ago and I've been learning and applying that new knowledge ever since.
#### Hard Skills
I’ve exposed myself to a wide variety of languages such as `C++, Java, Python, SQL and JavaScript`. Thus, I can read almost any code I see and _understand what’s happening_. 
Knowing a programming language isn’t enough, though! That’s where my **analytical thinking**, my **pattern recognition skills** and my **algorithmic-based reasoning** come in handy.
Specifically, I know:
- HTML5, CSS3, SCSS
- JS ES6, TypeScript
- Git, GitHub
- Node, Express, Webpack
- React, Redux
- SQL, PostgreSQL, Sequelize
- Unit testing (Mocha, Jest)
- Data structures and algorithms
- OOP
- Python

#### Soft skills
I've also worked on improving myself as a person. I **used to be very introverted and shy, but now I even have a good time meeting new people** and giving me the opportunity to learn from them.
Many people I've worked with say I'm a born leader who's also able to listen to others' opinion and experience - and I agree.
I'm really great at explaining complex matters in the simplest way so even people who might not be remotely close to my area of expertise are able to understand what I'm talking about (e.g., parents, friends, coaches). I adapt quickly to my environment, you could say.

## Interests 👀
I’m interested in web development, software engineering and the stock market
