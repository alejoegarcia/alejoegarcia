> I'm a nineteen-years-old backend-leaning full stack developer üë®üèΩ‚Äçüíª. I got into the programming world almost six years ago and I've been learning and applying that new knowledge ever since. See my [16personalities profile here!](https://www.16personalities.com/profiles/599ea04cab3b5)

## Hard Skills üìö
I‚Äôve exposed myself to a wide variety of languages such as `C++, Java, Python, SQL and JavaScript`. Thus, I can read almost any code I see and _understand what‚Äôs happening_. 
Knowing a programming language isn‚Äôt enough, though! That‚Äôs where my **analytical thinking**, my **pattern recognition skills** and my **algorithmic-based reasoning** come in handy.
Specifically, I know:

## Soft skills ü•≥
I've also worked on improving myself as a person. **I used to be very introverted and shy, but now I even have a good time meeting new people** and giving me the opportunity to learn from them.
Many people I've worked with say I'm a born leader who's also able to listen to others' opinion and experience - and I agree.
I'm really great at explaining complex matters in the simplest way so even people who might not be remotely close to my area of expertise are able to understand what I'm talking about (e.g., parents, friends, coaches). I adapt quickly to my environment, you could say.
